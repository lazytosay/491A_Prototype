##Before getting started
1. reference: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project

1. base folder is 491A_Prototype/front_end/
2.go to base folder
3. first you need to start the backend
4. in console, type: yarn start-api
5. open another console, second step is to start the front-end
6. go to base folder
7. in console, type: yarn start
8. leave the two consoles running
9. a page should pop-out after you start the front-end
10. you should see the time is updating on the bottom of the page
